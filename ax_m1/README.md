## AX-M1

This board design was originally designed for Mech Warfare, as a gun driver
board which would attach directly to the Bioloid bus. The NIF5003 SSR will
conduct up to 14A, enough to drive even the biggest Airsoft guns. In addition
to the motor driver, the board includes several (analog) IO, which could be
used for getting feedback from the gun.

Several of these boards were built and tested, although not extensively.
